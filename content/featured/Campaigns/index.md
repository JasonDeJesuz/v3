A platform where [DTBSA]('https://www.dtbsa.co.za') can showcase campaigns for Mercedes-Benz Trucks, Mercedes-Benz Buses and Truckstore. My responsibilities included full architecture, development and deployment of the entire Campaign Microsite without any guidance from project managers and more experienced developers.. My responsibilities also included retrieving all CI of all 3 websites, without having client provide a single file. The entire Microsite was created by mirroring the existing sites. The entire Campaign Microsite project was planned, developed, and deployed within 2 weeks of development.
