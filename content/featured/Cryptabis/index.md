Cryptabis is a innovative new seed to sale (STS) Software being introduced to South Africa for managing cannabis farms. My responsibilities included constructing the entire Architecture, Development and Deployment of the SaaS project without any guidance from project managers and more experienced developers. The entire project was pitched to me with a very vague idea, I successfully took the idea and converted it into a full solution ready for deployment anywhere. My responsibilities also included setting up Demo's for high profile investors, and pitching the entire system to them.
