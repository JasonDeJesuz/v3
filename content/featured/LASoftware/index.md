The Deceased Estate Administration Software assists with the complete step-by-step administration of a deceased estate from A-Z and automatically drafts and populates all the required documentation that must be submitted to the Master of the High Court as well as all other documentation that is required to attend to the winding up of an estate. New, exciting features such as financial projections, team management and more. My responsibilities included complete Architecture, Development, and Deployment of the SaaS project. 

I built the entire application off of an idea, without any real and structured documentation provided to me and without any guidance from project managers and more experienced developers. The entire project makes use of roughly 70+ database tables and 500+ fields, the application also makes use of complex accounting foundations, mathematical equations and complex PDF and Excel generation. 

The entire UI is built using a complex forms builder algorithm developed by myself, that allowed me to generate the entire wizard process without hard coding any HTML5 elements.
