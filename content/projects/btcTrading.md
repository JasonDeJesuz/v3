Earlier in 2021, I got involved in Trading Futures on Binance. I found that some of my executions were off when it came to timing on the shorter timeframes and my busy schedule, I decided to automate the process of creating BUY and SELL orders by receiving data from Tradingview using webhooks. The code in Tradingview is built using Pinescript and the actual bot API code base is built using Python and Django.
