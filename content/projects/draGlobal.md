My first corporate website, [DRA Global]("https://draglobal.com") website for corporate facing customers. The site has been built using Umbraco and SQL Server. In this project my role was to oversee all developer work, between myself and 2 other developers. We co-ordinated, mitigated and delagated tasks between each other to manage expectations with client. I was also in contact with the client directly to manage expectations, deadlines and deliverables without a project manager.
