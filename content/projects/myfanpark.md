Helped contribute to the initial and original build of the [Myfanpark]("https://myfanpark.com") build. I was responsible for developing and re-structuring the way the application handles Celebrities payouts when the celebrities want to withdraw their wallets, this involved my re-factoring the entire C# service used for Escrow payments, re-factoring the withdrawel functions on the mobile app built in flutter. My responsibilities also included re-architecting the entire Architecture of the Myfanpark system, using Azure we successfully moved all environments to Virtual Machines which saved money on a monthly basis. I did not have any assistance on this project, and was responsible for developing and deploying all newly built features on my own, without any guidance from project managers and more experienced developers.
