For this project I am going to be learning Game Development, and creating my own worlds by creating my own Game Objects and surroundings. The world is going to be my own playground, where users will be able to move around, drive cards, fly space ships, follow my life, view my projects etc...
The purpose of this website is going to be to get into Game Development, and then to document my own life in a fun and interesting way. Instead of having my life written down inside of a notebook, why not rather inside a game. Everything inside my little world will be created as a result of what is happening in my own life. Stay tune. üòÅ
